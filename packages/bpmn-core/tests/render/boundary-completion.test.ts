/**
 * Regression for the SYN013 family (all 11 `render_error` cases in the thesis
 * corpus): a trace ending on an interrupting boundary event produced a boundary
 * with no outgoing flow, and bpmn-auto-layout 0.5.0's attachersHandler crashed
 * with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reverse')". The semantic
 * pass now completes such boundaries with a synthesized end event, so layout
 * succeeds.
